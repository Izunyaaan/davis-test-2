                <legend>1. Describe the 'Bagging' technique. [7 marks]</legend>
                <p>
                    Bagging is a type of ensemble learning. Ensemble learning is taking the results of multiple models
                    and
                    returns one result based on this collection. Bagging is also known as bootstrap aggregation. It is a
                    technique that reduces variance in a noisy dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works is we create sample sets from the training data. It is typically smaller than the total
                    length of the training set. The sample sets are created by randomly picking data points from the
                    training dataset. This process is purely random and the selected data point still remains in the
                    training dataset. This means that it can be picked and added to the sample set again if the RNG
                    picks it
                    again. For example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assume the training dataset is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.<br>
                    We now want a subset of length 3. We randomly pick one data point from the training data and got 2.
                    We
                    randomly pick again and got 7. And we randomly pick again but the rng tells us to pick 2. Thus the
                    sample is now {2,7,2}.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technique of randomly picking data points and allowing the same data points to be chosen more
                    than
                    once is called <strong>resampling with replacement.</strong> This process of creating bootstrap
                    sample
                    sets is where the <em>bootstrap</em> in bootstrap aggregation comes from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we have multiple sample sets, we can use them to train weak learners such as logistic
                    regression. Typically we training using the same weak learner. So if we train one sample set with
                    logistic regression, the other sample sets are also trained using logistic regression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We now combine the results that we get from the weak learners. This is typically done by averaging.
                    This
                    aggregating process is where the <em>aggregation</em> in bootstrap aggregation comes from. This
                    averaging is how bagging reduces variance in a noisy dataset. And by using purely random datasets,
                    overfitting is also reduced.

                AdaBoost, which is short for Adaptive Boosting, is another ensemble learning technique. It is based on
                the boosting algorithm which is widely used for solving binary classification problems apparently.
                Boosting was first presented in 1997 by Freund and Schapire.
