                <legend>1. Describe the 'Bagging' technique. [7 marks]</legend>
                <p>
                    Bagging is a type of ensemble learning. Ensemble learning is taking the results of multiple models
                    and
                    returns one result based on this collection. Bagging is also known as bootstrap aggregation. It is a
                    technique that reduces variance in a noisy dataset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How it works is we create sample sets from the training data. It is typically smaller than the total
                    length of the training set. The sample sets are created by randomly picking data points from the
                    training dataset. This process is purely random and the selected data point still remains in the
                    training dataset. This means that it can be picked and added to the sample set again if the RNG
                    picks it
                    again. For example:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assume the training dataset is {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}.<br>
                    We now want a subset of length 3. We randomly pick one data point from the training data and got 2.
                    We
                    randomly pick again and got 7. And we randomly pick again but the rng tells us to pick 2. Thus the
                    sample is now {2,7,2}.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This technique of randomly picking data points and allowing the same data points to be chosen more
                    than
                    once is called <strong>resampling with replacement.</strong> This process of creating bootstrap
                    sample
                    sets is where the <em>bootstrap</em> in bootstrap aggregation comes from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Now that we have multiple sample sets, we can use them to train weak learners such as logistic
                    regression. Typically we training using the same weak learner. So if we train one sample set with
                    logistic regression, the other sample sets are also trained using logistic regression.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We now combine the results that we get from the weak learners. This is typically done by averaging.
                    This
                    aggregating process is where the <em>aggregation</em> in bootstrap aggregation comes from. This
                    averaging is how bagging reduces variance in a noisy dataset. And by using purely random datasets,
                    overfitting is also reduced.

                <legend>2. Describe the 'Adaboost' technique. [7 marks]</legend>
                <p>
                    AdaBoost, which is short for Adaptive Boosting, is another ensemble learning technique. It is based
                    on the boosting algorithm which is widely used for solving binary classification problems
                    apparently.
                    Boosting was first presented in 1997 by Freund and Schapire.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Boosting is basically building models repeatedly, each repetition boosting the accuracy of the next
                    model (thus the name), until the final model gives a satisfactory result. This sounds like it would
                    cause overfitting, but by being careful and employing techniques such as cross validation, using
                    small learning rates and others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The AdaBoost algorithm works by assigning weights to data points. On the first run, all data points
                    have equal weights. This is then fed into a model and once we get an output, the weights of the data
                    points that were misclassified are increased. This affectively means that these points have a higher
                    importance when fed into the next model. By adapting these weights to perform the boosting is why
                    this technique is called Adaptive Boosting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final step is to make a final model using the weighted average of the individual models to
                    aggregate the findings (it is an ensemble learning technique).
                </p>

                <p>The blue shaded area shows the misclassified data points. And we can see the final decision boundary
                    is an average we get from combining all three models.</p>
                <p>
                    According to Saini, A. (2021), AdaBoost is typically used with decision trees with only one split
                    called <strong>Decision Stump</strong>/

                            A box plot, also sometimes called box and whisker plots, is a type of plot that is used in
                            descriptive statistics to show the locality, spread and skewness of a dataset through their
                            quartiles. The image below shows how they look like:
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As we can see, the box covers the inter-quartile range with the whiskers typically extending
                            to
                            the min and max values. There is a line in the box which is the median of the data. A well
                            balanced dataset will have the median in the center of the box and the whisker length be the
                            same as the box length. The skewness can be seen by how uneven the box and whiskers are.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some variation of box plots are shown below:

                            spread. They can also be used to infer the quality of the dataset. More outliers means
                            either the measuring method has problems or is unsuitable to collect that particular set of
                            data.

                            A distribution plot at first glance might have the same idea as a box plot. However, rather
                            than just key values such as
                            the median, mean and IQR, a distribution plot will plot each data point in a single line.
                            This means we can see the
                            range and the distribution of the points as the name suggests.

                            In Matlab though, they describe distribution plots as "Distribution plots visually assess
                            the distribution of sample data by comparing the empirical distribution of the data
                            with the theoretical values expected from a specified distribution. Use distribution plots
                            in addition to more formal
                            hypothesis tests to determine whether the sample data comes from a specified distribution"
                            which effectively means the distribution plot is a 2d chart with data one one axis and the
                            theoretical value on the other. Combining this with techniques such as binning, using
                            probabilities and etc, we get different types of charts such as histogram, line and point
                            charts.

                            Distribution plots are best used to express the distribution of data. It can show the
                            variance between two datasets, we can intuit the skew of the data (data with points evenly
                            spaced out are balanced), and we can easily see how different datasets compare with each
                            other (their position along the axis can show magnitude differences, size differences,
                            variances and etc).

                    Maps are typically used to represent geolocation data. However it is not strictly just for this. In
                    recent years, maps have also been used to represent big data clusters, network distribution and
                    connectivity data. Basically, any type of data with spatial properties is best illustrated by maps.

                    Tables are a method of illustrating values that have labels. It works by having the labels on the
                    axis and the values that have those labels at the intersect. The difference between a table and a
                    graph is that tables are text based representations while graphs are more graphical. I.e. in graphs
                    the values are represented as a point while in a table, it is a cell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Tables are commonly 2D, with a header as one axis and a column of properties as the other axis. An
                    example is table of contents with page number as one axis, and book section as the other axis. The
                    value of the intersect is the page number.

                <p>Graphs are graphical illustration of data that's meant to show the interrelation between things by
                    using dots, lines and bars. Usually graphs can be used to extract mathematical relationship between
                    data. Some may argue that charts like pie charts is also part of graphs but this is debatable. I
                    will assume here that charts and graphs are interchangable (more or less the same)</p>

                <p>There is a saying, <strong>pictures paint a thousand words</strong>. This is because the human mind
                    is extremely good at grasping patterns from sight. It is more intuitive to look at a picture than to
                    imagine the same thing from a simple description. There is also a problem where individual
                    interpretation of data varies from people to people.</p>
                <p>For example:</p>

                <p>When we see this diagram we can see a clear crisscross pattern that is not noticable from just a list
                    of {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23...104729}</p>
                <p>Although all phenomenon in this universe can be described using numbers one way or another. Be it
                    physics equations, Fibonacci sequence, golden ratio and other beautiful equations, the human brain
                    is just not suitable for interpreting numerical data as we have adapted to use our visual cortex.
                    Our brain automatically interprets data in its own way and comes to the same result as using numbers
                    for calculations. This is why we built computers to do complicated calculations and formed formulae
                    and algorithms to determine complex relationships. Our brains simply cannot process numbers as
                    easily as it does graphics.</p>
                <p>However, not every data visualization is the same. Some perform better for a certain type of dataset
                    than others. Which is also why there are so many types of data visualizations, ranging from
                    informatics to charts. Everything depends on the data being represented. And as humans we are also
                    more interested in moving representations for changing data and etc.</p>
                <p>
                    A simple example is a linear regression. When we see {1,2,3,4,5} we can assume that the next number
                    is 7. But what with {0, 4.14, 8.28, 12.42, 20.6}. Just looking at it we cannot see the pattern but
                    it is x=n(&pi;+1). If we plotted this on a line graph:

                <p>The same comes when trying to interpret equations. For example, if we want to decide if D = log N/log
                    S will converge or not it would be impossible just by seeing the number output. However, if we look
                    at the visualization:</p>

                </p>
                <p>We can now see that the equation will not converge even though the numbers are seemingly getting

                <legend>6. D3 stands for Data-Driven-Documents, D3 is a powerful data visualization tool by many.
                    Describe
                    three
                    salient features of D3 over traditional graphing tools. [6 marks]</legend>
                <p>Let us first define what traditional graphing tools are. They are frameworks that allow users to
                    choose from their available types of charts and takes in preprocessed input to visualize the data.
                </p>
                <p>While D3 can also do this, it does much much more. Here are some of the differences that I can see
                    from briefly using D3</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        In D3, we can fit the visualization to the data rather than fitting the data to the
                        visualization. This allows enormous flexibility in generating beautiful visualizations that
                        would be difficult or even impossible in traditional graphing tools. For example, <a
                            href="https://observablehq.com/@d3/mona-lisa-histogram">this</a> is impossible with
                        traditional graphing tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Unlike traditional tools, D3 does not have a specific feature. Meaning the process for building
                        a table is the same as the process for building bubble charts and is also the same for any other
                        types of visualization. This means the visualization depends on the user's own ideas and their
                        own programming skills. D3 simply provides API functions to assist the user.<br>
                        In simpler terms, a user can use D3 like they are painting on paper using pencil however they
                        want while traditional tools only allows you to paint on paper using predetermined stamps which
                        limits the user greatly.<br>
                        D3 is simply a tool to turn data into graphics, and not a framework or library for generating
                        preset graphs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        D3 uses the web standards meaning integration with web pages is easy without needing the use of
                        plugins or any other assistive technology. Something built with D3 will work fine on any modern
                        web browser straight out the box. Although this is not unique to D3, it has such an amazing
                        community, support and documentation it makes a clear difference compared to the other tools.
                        Other tools like Plotly builds upon D3 to provide the traditional graphing tools "templates"
                        which makes D3 that much more accessible.
                    </li>

                        Just incase #1 and #2 are similar, the other advantage of D3 working using web standards is that
                        it has direct DOM manipulation capabilities. Traditionally, visualization tools requires a user
                        to create a canvas or specify a div and many other things in order to work. But D3's seamless
                        DOM manipulation ability means the user is not limited in how they want to present their data
                        and can even make their visualization interactive, animated and adapt to the end-user's devices.

                <legend>7. Explain ethical issues that may be of concerns when designing visualization e.g., concerns
                    regarding
                    genders, religions, races, or other dimensions that you can think of (open question). [7 marks]
                </legend>
                As mentioned in Q5, visualization works by stimulating the viewer's intuition. But this also means that
                the viewer's observation will be affected by their own subjective values. Most of the time, a message is
                delivered exactly as the creator, the creator's biases and values may be different to the viewers.
                Especially if the visualization in a custom form of media such as infographics. But even before that,
                some people perceive their surroundings differently from others. For example, I have very bad eyesight
                and have red/green colour blindness. This means that I prefer a visualization that doesn't rely heavily
                on colour and doesn't have too much little details as it takes longer for me to analyze the whole thing.
                And as we know, if you can't attract in as little as 0.2 seconds, then interest is lost. This means the
                visualization will not have a chance to deliver the information and data it wanted to.
                <p>So the first consideration I think is accessibility. Luckily there are many authorities that have
                    guidelines that can be followed to help make the visualization accessible. One example is the WCAG
                    for web.</p>
                <p>
                    Next is the personal perception. Using the example of gender, males traditionally prefers action and
                    so having an interactive visualization would cater to them more. But females typically are passive
                    and so they might prefer a different type of visualization. From this we can see that making a
                    visualization that is not traditional (such as graphs and maps) that delivers the information
                    effectively to everyone is very hard. So the target demography is also quite important. Knowing this
                    in advance can help create a better visualization. Especially in today's society where even my
                    statement of males and females being active vs passive could be considered offensive and sexist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This also leads to another issue which is the societal norms. We in Brunei would not have been too
                    offended by the gender differentiation, but a country like America would have tried to sue me
                    already.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The modern society is no longer as religiously sensitive. However this is not everyone. Some are
                    still very defensive about their religion and do not like religious symbolism. For muslims, we
                    cannot place quranic verses (in arabic) onto media that would be taken into unclean places such as
                    the toilet. So an infographic that tells people to wash their hands and contains a quranic verse
                    that may say "stay clean for cleanliness is one step closer to heaven" might be very compelling. But
                    if it is placed in a toilet to remind people to wash their hands then it is blasphemous thus making
                    the infographic useless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Similarly, a portrait of the Buddha running on a treadmill in the Gym might be offensive to
                    buddhist. Thus the creator needs to again understand their target audience and empathize with their
                    values.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Colour also plays a very important role not only for disability accessibility, but also because of
                    the psychological effect colours invoke. Red and Yellow makes us hungry. Thus the famous Mc Donald
                    archers. Or this may be because of Mc Donald I'm not sure. Purple gives a sense of grandeur because
                    it is such a rare colour in nature. So making sure the information matches the correct colour is
                    vital. A green STOP sign <strong>WILL</strong> cause accidents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I've also mentioned about traditional visualization tools such as graphs and charts. These can be
                    abused to misrepresent a dataset to fit whatever the creator wants it to show. This is a
                    particularly hot ethical issue because it called into question the validity of evidence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some type of data is sensitive to some races. African Americans may find it offensive to see data
                    about slavery for example. In today's society, this is less of an issue but racism still exists and
                    so is a potential ethical issue.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One big tool in visualization is symbolism. As mentioned in the lecture, a portraits used to be more
                    symbolic. An issue that can arise from using symbolism is not just all the above (religion, races,
                    gender) but even misrepresentation. Different time periods have different ways of interpreting what
                    they see. This is due to enviromental factors and the common sense of the era. Thus, using outdated
                    symbolism can be misleading and even give rise to ethical issues. For example, if a court jester is
                    standing closer to the artist point of view then he will be larger than a king sitting further away.
                    But from an ancient intepretation where size equal authority, this type of illustration implies a
                    jester has more authority than a king. Obviously the artist will be losing his head after he
                    finished painting that. So to create a visualization that will endure through the ages is difficult.
                    Conventions may change but it's still better to follow the current conventions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Misrepresentation is a big ethical dilemma due to how our society works. Liability is an issue that
                    is hard to handle. If we make a visualization that caused a misunderstanding that created damage,
                    are we liable for that? As such the creator needs to be ethically bound to represent their data as
                    intended and not to be misleading.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There can also be an issue of privacy. For example, a chart comparing ages could be considered
                    offensive. Therefore proper preprocessing of data is another thing a creator needs to be concerned
                    about.
